Story: 
Scene1) 2D animation
Change and his child, Child, resides on future earth, a broken world destroyed by climate change and the sins of humankind. One day, while in their bunker, Child asked Change to take him to see all the wondrous animals and scenery in the books and pictures that grandma showed him. However, the animals’ Child wanted to see were long extinct, and the beautiful world outside, now a dark and desolate environment. Change, sharing the same sentiments and hoping to please his son, turns back time and alters the future by preventing climate change. 

Scene2) Game
Change battles climate change in the past by doing everything he can, represented in the game metaphorically by launching balls of clean energy, representing humanity’s effort, at enemies called smogs, that represent smog and factors that contribute to climate change.
	Style) 3D, cartoon-like
	Gameplay) First-person, climate change bar at the right of screen (when full, game ends), Reload bar at top (center is reload timer, left is amount of ammo before reload, and right is total ammo), pledges to do things about climate change under bar(change every reload).

Scene3) End message
In the end, no matter what Change does, he is unable to change the past. However, we, the people in the real world, have the choice and ability to avoid this future. With enough effort, humanity can evade the tragic fate of a decimated earth and create a bright, prosperous, healthy future for future generations. Please advocate for climate change, and strive to consume less energy. 

All things were self-made except: music, terrain decoration assets, and textures.
